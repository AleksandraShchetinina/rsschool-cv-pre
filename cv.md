#### ABOUT ME
My name is Alexandra! I am 29 years old. I love to travel, fish, and hang out with friends. She worked as a teacher for a long time. Recently I have been working in 1C technical support. I like to study and learn something new. Why not try to start programming in a "normal" language? That's why I didn't sign up for this course. Let's see what happens?
